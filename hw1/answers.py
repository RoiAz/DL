part1_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**

1.**False**
The in-sample error is the error rate you get on the same data-set you used to build your predictor.
The test set is responsible to indicate the out-sample error.

2.**False**
The quality of the predictor is dirrectly effected from the train set it used to practice on.
Therefore, different splits might result with different predicators.
It is intuitive to understand the claim in case of a tiny train-set, where different splits will probably lead to total diffrenet predicators.

3.**True**
The test-set is not responsible for chosing the hyper/parameters of the model.
Cross-validation/Training process does that.

4.**False**
The generalization-error (or the out-sample error) is defined by the test-set which doesn't take part in the cross-validation process.
The performance of all folds will define the model's proxy in-sample error.

part1_q2 = r"""
**Your answer:**

**My friend's approach is wrong**
You don't supose to choose hyper-parameters based on test-set.Because, it results with over-fitting on the test-set.
